### 1.1.4 at 12 January 2023

- In gateway side in Admin panel in "Subordinated services" the token field mode changed to read-write. Reason: If in an service just need to change token and and keep requests stats on. Also this fixes bug, when new instance have different token before and after saving. 
- Fixed critical bug: If an subordinated service is off-line - any login action in the SSO gateway takes exception. Now behavior changed to short timeout of waiting for alive and reply else will skip broadcasting events (Find `SSO_SUBORDINATE_COMMUNICATION_TIMEOUT` variable in [README.md](README.md))
- Documentation updated.
- For superusers allowed deletion in "Single Sign-On › Authentication requests". Reason: Need full control without any developer actions.
- Deauthentication event was not send in SSO mechanism. Now it's works. When user logging out in subordinated service or gateway - user logout everywhere.
